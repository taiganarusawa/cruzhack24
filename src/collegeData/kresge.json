   "studentDesc": "They just built new dorms here, they're by far the nicest on campus. The rest of Kresge is pretty old though. The new buildings have larger lecture halls, so there might be more people coming through. Dining is pretty far though. The classrooms here look pretty funky too, interesting place to live.",
