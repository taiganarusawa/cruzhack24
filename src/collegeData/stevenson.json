   "officialDesc": "Welcome to Stevenson College. Founded in 1966, Stevenson is one of the first colleges at UCSC. We are located on a hill overlooking the beautiful Monterey Bay, close to the University restaurants and shops, library, pool, track, and gym. Our theme, \"Self and Society\", emphasizes the goal of both self-understanding and active participation in oneâ€˜s community. Stevenson students major in a wide array of fields - humanities, social sciences, natural sciences, the arts, and engineering. Our students' wide range of backgrounds, perspectives and interests, our 2-quarter core course - \"Self and Society\" and our wide array of lectures and community events contribute to making Stevenson an especially stimulating environment.",
   "studentDesc": "Similar to Cowell, and its neighbor in fact. It's nearby the gym and the edge of campus, so it's a nice balance of quiet and activity. Nice areas to study, and contains the Stevenson library (small and cramped) and lounge. Consists of mostly business/humanities majors. ",
