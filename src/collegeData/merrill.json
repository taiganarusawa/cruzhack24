The social atmosphere at Merrill College—situated in a beautiful, compact pocket of redwood trees—is friendly, focused, engaged, and accepting.",
   "studentDesc": "Quiet, dorms are ok, not much to do here. Merrill Market is located here so you don't have to go across campus to Porter Market. Open grass area though, so sunny days are nice. Close to Crown, so be wary of CS majors. They scare easily and will run away Naruto-style in self defense. Also located on a big hill, so we no likey.",
