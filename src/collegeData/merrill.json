   "officialDesc": "Merrill is a stimulating and innovative college in which to learn. Our students, faculty, and staff represent numerous cultural groups and nationalities. Merrill's central values are to stimulate respect for all world cultures, in general, and for the cultural heritage of each Merrill student in particular. The social atmosphere at Merrill College—situated in a beautiful, compact pocket of redwood trees—is friendly, focused, engaged, and accepting.",
   "studentDesc": "Quiet, dorms are ok, but pretty small. Overall, not much to do here. Merrill Market is located here, really awesome place to go if you have too many SlugPoints! (Also for stocking up on energy drinks). It's basically the same as Porter Market. Open grass area though, so sunny days are nice. Close to Crown, so also has more STEM. Merrill is also on a really big hill!",
