   "officialDesc": "We are a diverse community of students, faculty, and staff dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge in an atmosphere of open discussion and mutual respect. In embracing this diversity, we find stimulation, freedom, and strength. Freedom to express one’s opinions and beliefs is of the utmost importance. Founded in 1967 as the third college in the UC Santa Cruz system, our theme Science and Technology in Society explores the relationship between science and technology with the world around us. This interdisciplinary reflection is modeled in our core course Ethical and Political Issues in Emerging Technologies. Although traditionally viewed as the “science college”, half of our student body major in fields other than science.",
   "studentDesc": "Quiet and small dorms. Dorms aren't in the best shape, but are cozy enough. Not much social activity. Lots of CS majors, and known as the college with a lot of gamers. Lots of esports people live here too. Climbing up the hill will get you UC Sexy Calves in no time.",
