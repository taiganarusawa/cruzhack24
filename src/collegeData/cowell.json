   "studentDesc": "Actually pretty nice. Dorms are small, showers are scary, but socially active! Known to have more sporty/athletic people. Nice open areas with grass to sit on. Located almost at the center of campus, it's close to the gym, close enough to the library, and near enough stuff to not feel isolated.",
