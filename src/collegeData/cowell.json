   "collegeName": "Cowell College",
   "officialDesc": "Founded in 1965, Cowell was the first residential college of UCSC. The college is named after Henry Cowell and the Cowell family, who lived on the land that is now UCSC. The land was acquired by the University of California for the purpose of founding a university based on innovative teaching methods, cross-disciplinary undergraduate education, progressive and modern research. Cowell has focused not on a theme or a specific set of disciplines, but on a motto: The Pursuit of Truth in the Company of Friends. Convinced that learning involves a committed search for knowledge through reasoned discussion and debate and that such debate develops best in an atmosphere of mutual respect and friendship, the faculty, staff, and student leadership of Cowell College invite you to challenge yourself with new ideas, to think and reason with vigor, and to extend a hand of friendship to your companions in this endeavor.",
   "studentDesc": "Actually pretty nice. Dorms are small, showers are scary, but hey, at least there's social activity. The one spot on campus with mostly white people socializing. Nice open areas with grass to sit on. Located almost at the center of campus, it's close to the gym, close enough to the library, and near enough stuff to not feel isolated.",
