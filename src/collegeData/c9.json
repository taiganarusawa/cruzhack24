   "studentDesc": "Home of many, many CS majors. Of course, you'll find other majors here. But almost exclusively STEM majors. It's not as quiet as Crown/Merrill, but still pretty quiet. Very little grass to lie down on, and as CS majors don't touch grass, it stays pretty empty. The closest college to Tree 9, home of the infamous tree raves, getting there and back is super easy. Also, classes aren't too far. Also also, lots of international students here! ",
