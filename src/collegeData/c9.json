   "officialDesc": "College Nine opened in 2000 and its theme of international and global perspectives recognizes the importance of cultural competency in the 21st century. The College Nine community offers students a range of opportunities to explore these issues and to develop skills as dynamic leaders.",
   "studentDesc": "College Nine: Home of antisocial CS majors. Of course, you'll find other majors here. But exclusively STEM majors. It's not as quiet as Crown/Merill, but don't let that fool you. Very little grass to lie down on, and as CS majors don't touch grass, you'll never see them on the little grass there is. The closest college to Tree 9, home of the infamous tree raves, getting there and back is super easy.",
